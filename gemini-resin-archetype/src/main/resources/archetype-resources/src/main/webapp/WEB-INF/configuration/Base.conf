# Configuration file
#
# BASELINE Configuration
#
# This configuration file specifies application default behavior that is
# suitable where not superseded by deployment-specific configuration
# files.  Refer to the separate deployment-specific configuration files
# (such as Dev.conf).
#
# The automatically-generated configuration files align with generic
# deployment "roles" (Development, Test, and Production).  It is common
# practice, however, to have additional machine-specific configuration
# files.  This allows for configuration attributes to be distributed
# between so that, for example, all development environments can use
# attributes specific in a Development configuration file.  For example:
#
#    Base.conf - Baseline configuration
#    Dev.conf - Standard development configuration specifics
#    BLACKPARK.conf - Specifics for a machine named Blackpark.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# AUTO GENERATED CONFIGURATION FILE NOTICE:
#   Search for lines that contain "EDIT THIS" for AUTO-GENERATED items
#   that you can edit for additional functionality.
#
# Notes:
#   Lines that begin with # are comments.  Empty lines are ignored.  Each
#   entry in this file is described immediately above the provided value.
#
#   Any Windows-style paths must have back-slashes (\) escaped as \\ or
#   where possible use forward-slashes (/).
