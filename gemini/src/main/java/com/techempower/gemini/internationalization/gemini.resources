#
# Note: this file is named gemini.resources, but should be
# renamed to [product-name].resources for your application and placed
# alongside the .conf file for your application.  When changes are made
# to the user interface of Gemini, this file will need to be changed and
# those changes will need to be mirrored in the .resources files of each
# application using Gemini.  To be on the safe side, it's probably best to
# not edit the Gemini-specific sections of this file, allowing you to
# copy & paste any updates into your application-specific .resources file
# easily.
#
# The naming convention of resources files is:
#
#   gemini.resources = "template" default Gemini UI resources, as stored in
#     SourceSafe.  See the comments above.
#
#   gemini-en-US.resources = "template" Gemini UI for the US English locale.
#
#   gemini-fr-CA.resources = Example of Gemini UI for Canadian French.
#
#   tempest.resources = A default resources file for the application named
#     Tempest.  The application author copies the Gemini UI resources from
#     gemini.resources.
#
#   tempest-en-US.resources = If Tempest is locale-aware, additional
#     resource files may exist for it.  Again, each shall contain the stock
#     Gemini UI resources for the specific locale.
#
# The naming convention of keys used by Gemini is:
#   g = indicates this key is for Gemini
#   [class-abbreviation] = lowercase class abbreviation
#   -identifier = A class-specific identifier for the resource
#
# For form elements, the following suffices are used:
#   -e = Error text (for debugging)
#   -i = Instructions text (for displaying in a bulleted list to the user)
#   -l = Inline instructions text (for displaying alongside form elements)
